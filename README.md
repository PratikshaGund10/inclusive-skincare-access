# Inclusive Skincare Access: A Geo-Demographic Micromarketing Project

This project uses data science, spatial analytics, and micromarketing to identify and prioritize outreach opportunities for **inclusive skincare access** among **Hispanic women aged 15–44**—a fast-growing, underrepresented demographic in the wellness space.

Each phase is grounded in real data and business logic, designed to be scalable, replicable, and community-driven. This project not only empowers equitable access to wellness but also models how brands can achieve **targeted growth** while driving **social impact**.

## Project Workflow Overview

| Phase | Description | Why It Matters |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Phase 1 | State Selection | Identify the best state to launch outreach, ensuring demographic and spending alignment |
| Phase 2 | ZIP-to-County Aggregation | Reveal top counties in target state using population and purchase trends |
| Phase 3 | Trade Area Definition | Focus on neighborhoods with highest target group concentration |
| Phase 4 | Retail Partner & Buyer Estimation | Select best store hub to distribute kits and forecast buyer volume |
| Phase 5 | Lifestyle Segmentation | Understand local attitudes, values, and income to tailor outreach |
| Phase 6 | Scalability Modeling | Identify lookalike trade areas for regional expansion |

## Phase 1: State Selection

We used Alteryx + Esri 2024 data to evaluate where Hispanic women aged 15–44 are most concentrated, and where skincare spend is meaningful.
